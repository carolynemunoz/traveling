            <h3> Budgeting and Saving  </h3>    
        
       <p> The currency is the Mexican Peso (MXN). Use local ATMs for the best exchange rates and avoid high exchange fees to save a little extra money. </p>      
              
       <p> Major expenses would be:               <li> Flights, $200–$600 round trip from the U.S. or Canada (depending on season and airline). I would recommend traveling during late November or early May (great balance of weather and affordability).</li>
              
       <li> Accommodation: $20–$200+ per night (hostels to luxury resorts). </li>
              
       <li> Food: $5–$20 per meal (street tacos vs. upscale dining).</li>
              
       <li> Transport: $1–$20 (buses, taxis, or car rentals). </li>
              
       <li>  Tours/Activities: $20–$100+ per experience (e.g., cenote swimming, ruins, snorkeling).</li> </p>
