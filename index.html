       <p> In Mexico, credit/debit cards can be used but if you're going to shop at local markets and small towns then you should carry cash as they usually don't accept cards. </p>
          
       <p> In high tourists places such as Cancun for example have adopted the use of dollars in whatever case you don't have pesos on you. </p>
